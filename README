A simple TEI-based Leitner-like vocab memorisation tool for Android mobile 
phones. The basic goal is to enabling the use of TEI-based bi-lingual 
dictionaries as vocabularisation tools in such a way as to lose non of the 
information in the original TEI.

Technically the project is an eclipse/Java project using the eclipse 
android plugins, but not the eclipse git plugin.
